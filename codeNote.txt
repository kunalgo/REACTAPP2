Inro___________

1.
install node 32 bit.

    write code in cmd prompt :

	npm rm -g create-react-app
	npm install -g create-react-app
	npx create-react-app my-app

__Components__

2.
  counter-app created.
  npm i bootstrap@4.1.1

3.
  creating component.

5.
  setting variable

6.
  Here we setting attribute like className and style

7.
  Rendering class dynamically

8.
  Here we are rendering a list of element of an array.
  when we use map function we must use a key value.

9.
  conditional rendering in truthy way or function way.

10.
  using handleEvents

11.
  for binding an eventHandler we can either use "Constructor-Approach" or "Arrow-methods".

12.
  updating the state by setState

14.
  when we pass argument with our events we can use inline function.


____________Composing Components___________

2.
  we are using the same component multiple time

3. Every React component has a property called prop.
   its basically an object.
   it include all the attribute that we set in counters component.

4_ HERE we are using children property.

5_ installing the "React App Developer".

6_ props is the data that we give to component.
   state is the data that local to that component.

   React doesnot allow us to change the value of props.

7_ Here we are raising onDelete event in counter module
   and deleting the needed counter element in Counters module by sending the element in props.

8_ here we are deleting the id by sending id with props. and
   at the same time i am sending object not any property.
   so i am replacing the sending of properties by sending object directly.

9_ in single source of truth, we need to remove the local state in our counter component,
    and have a single source of truth.

10__ Here we are removing the local state.
     A controlled component doesnot have its own local state, it recives all the data via props.
     and raised an event when ever data needs to be changed. so this components entirely controls by its parents.

11_ introducing Navbar component and setting all as this conditions

12_ shifting the state one state up.

13_ introducing SFC (stateless functional component),
    here we dont use {this}

14_ here we are destructuring the argument

15_ life cycle Hooks ( cc)
    
16_ Mounting Phase

4.17_ updating phase

4.18_ unmounting phase

4.20_ introducing decrement options
